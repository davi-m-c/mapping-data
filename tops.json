        "This wonderfully \"juicy\" 2004 Estate Cuvee is unique in that a percentage of the blend was \"co\u2013fermented,\" due to the fact that all three of the varieties that comprise Estate Cuvee - Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Petit Verdot - arrived at maturity simultaneously. For the first time in his 24 years as a wine maker, Stephan saw these grapes fermenting in the same tank. The result is a seamless, complex work of art. Fresh aromas of plums, macerated blackberries, and blueberries in the nose, and dark, intense fruit on the palate. The mouth and lengthy finish are made more complex by hints of leather, tar, and tobacco leaf. An augmentation of Petit Verdot puts the 2004 on the classic track of the 2001 vintage."

        "\"A thrilling, nearly perfect efforts is the 2006 Estate Cuvee. A blend of 49% Syrah, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 4% Petit Verdot, the 2006 Estate Cuvee may be even better. Tasting like a superb example of a premier grand cru St.-Emilion made from California-s limestone soils, it exhibits a dense purple color as well as a perfume of sweet creme de cassis, fruitcake, licorice, incense, tobacco leaf, and spice box. A voluptuous texture, fabulous opulence, and thrilling concentration as well as purity make for a prodigious example of blended red wine that will provide enormous pleasure and complexity for 12-15+ years."
